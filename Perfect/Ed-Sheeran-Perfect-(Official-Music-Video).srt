00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:26,018
I found a love for me

2
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:30,403
Darling just dive right in

3
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,906
And follow my lead

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,999
Well I found a girl beautiful
and sweet

5
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:49,310
I never knew you were the
someone waiting for me

6
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:54,107
′Cause we were just kids
when we fell in love

7
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:58,004
Not knowing what it was

8
00:00:58,104 --> 00:01:05,653
I will not give you up this time

9
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:12,902
But darling‚ just kiss me slow‚
your heart is all I own

10
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:19,113
And in your eyes You are holding mine

11
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:31,116
Baby‚ I am dancing in the dark
with you between my arms

12
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:38,205
Barefoot on the grass‚ listening
to our favorite song

13
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,318
When you said you looked a mess‚ I
whispered underneath my breath

14
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:53,305
But you heard it‚ darling‚
you look perfect tonight

15
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:05,606
Well I found a woman‚ stronger
than anyone I know

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,699
She shares my dreams‚ I hope that
someday I will share her home

17
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:21,802
I found a love‚ to carry more
than just my secrets

18
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:28,103
To carry love‚ to carry
children of our own

19
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,698
We are still kids‚ but
We are so in love

20
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,509
Fighting against all odds

21
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:44,104
I know we′ll be alright this time

22
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,611
Darling‚ just hold my hand

23
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:51,616
Be my girl‚ I will be your man

24
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:58,105
I see my future in your eyes

25
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:09,614
Baby‚ I am dancing in the dark‚
with you between my arms

26
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:16,707
Barefoot on the grass‚ listening
to our favorite song

27
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:22,700
When I saw you in that dress‚
looking so beautiful

28
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:31,413
I don′t deserve this‚ darling‚
you look perfect tonight

29
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:55,004
Baby‚ I am dancing in the dark‚
with you between my arms

30
00:03:55,106 --> 00:04:02,005
Barefoot on the grass‚ listening
to our favorite song

31
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,416
I have faith in what I see

32
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,809
Now I know I have met
an angel in person

33
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:15,706
And she looks perfect

34
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:19,705
I don′t deserve this

35
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:24,300
You look perfect tonight

36
