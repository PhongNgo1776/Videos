1
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:07,603
I have been staring at the
edge of the water

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,132
Long as I can remember

3
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:14,883
Never really knowing why

4
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:19,282
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

5
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:22,711
But I come back to the water

6
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:26,482
No matter how hard I try

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,099
Every turn I take‚ every trail I track

8
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,250
Every path I make‚ every
road leads back

9
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:35,783
To the place I know where I cannot go

10
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,544
Where I long to be

11
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,341
See the line where the
sky mets the sea

12
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:43,784
It calls me

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,775
And no one knows

14
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:49,780
How far it goes

15
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:54,505
If the wind in my sail on
the sea stays behind me

16
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:58,370
One day I will know

17
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:01,847
If I go‚ there′s just no telling
how far I will go

18
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:06,370
I know everybody on this island

19
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,781
Seems so happy on this island

20
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,668
Everything is by design

21
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,443
(snorting)

22
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:15,476
I know everybody

23
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:15,512
On this island

24
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:17,346
(children laughing)

25
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:20,471
Has a role on this island

26
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,218
So maybe I can roll with mine

27
00:01:24,236 --> 00:01:27,435
I can lead with pride‚
I can make us strong

28
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,168
I will be satisfied if I play along

29
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:32,351
But the voice inside sings
a different song

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,650
What is wrong with me?

31
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:40,869
See the light as it shines on the sea

32
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,866
It is blinding

33
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:46,505
But no one knows

34
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,718
How deep it goes

35
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:52,385
And it seems like It is
calling out to me

36
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:55,340
So come find me

37
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:57,877
And let me know

38
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,584
What′s beyond that line‚ will
I cross that line?

39
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,751
The line where the sky mets the sea

40
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,614
It calls me

41
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,715
And no one knows

42
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,884
How far it goes

43
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:17,849
If the wind in my sail on
the sea stays behind me

44
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,444
One day I will know

45
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:27,551
How far I will go

46
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,748
Whoa! (groans)

47
00:02:31,748 --> 00:02:40,748
