1
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:14,606
Every inch of me is trembling

2
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:19,813
But not from the cold

3
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:22,316
Something is familiar

4
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:27,417
Like a dream I can reach
but not quite hold

5
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,210
I can sense you there

6
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:35,357
Like a friend I have always known

7
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,658
I am arriving

8
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:43,417
And it feels like I am home

9
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,210
I have always been a fortress

10
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:52,213
Cold secrets deep inside

11
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:55,804
You have secrets‚ too

12
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:00,013
But you don′t have to hide

13
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,810
Show yourself

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,999
I am dying to met you

15
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:09,014
Show yourself

16
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:12,305
It is your turn

17
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:15,516
Are you the one I have
been looking for

18
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,017
All of my life?

19
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:23,014
Show yourself

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,399
I am ready to learn

21
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,412
I have never felt so certain

22
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:40,907
All my life I have been torn

23
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,102
But I am here for a reason

24
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:48,605
Could it be the reason I was born?

25
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:52,200
I have always been so different

26
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:56,001
Normal rules did not apply

27
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:58,210
Is this the day?

28
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,199
Are you the way

29
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:04,412
I finally find out why?

30
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,611
Show yourself

31
00:02:07,113 --> 00:02:10,012
I am no longer trembling

32
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:12,007
Here I am

33
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:15,802
I have come so far

34
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,917
You are the answer I have waited for

35
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,812
All of my life

36
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:26,113
Oh‚ show yourself

37
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:31,004
Let me see who you are

38
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:35,065
Come to me now

39
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:39,016
Open your door

40
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:42,601
Don′t make me wait

41
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:46,214
One moment more

42
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:50,215
Oh‚ come to me now

43
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:54,000
Open your door

44
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:57,905
Don′t make me wait

45
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:08,718
One moment more

46
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:16,513
Where the north wind mets the sea

47
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:20,210
There′s a river

48
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:23,603
Full of memory

49
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:29,212
Come‚ my darling‚ homeward bound

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,199
I am found

51
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,198
Show yourself

52
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:39,605
Step into your power

53
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,408
Grow yourself

54
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:45,417
Into something new

55
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:48,758
You are the one You have
been waiting for

56
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:52,615
All of my life

57
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,408
Oh‚ show yourself

58
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:08,309
You
