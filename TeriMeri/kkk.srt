Teri Meri, Meri Teri Prem Kahani Hai Mushkil
Yours and Mine, Mine and Yours, Our Love Story is tough

00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:44,260
Do Lafzon Mein Yeh Bayaan Na Ho Paaye
It can't be Expressed in Just a couple of Verses

4
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,730
Ik Ladka, Ik Ladki Ki Yeh Kahani Hai Nayi
This is a new kind of Story of a Boy and a Girl

5
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:58,530
Do Lafzon Mein Yeh Bayaan Na Ho Paaye
It can't be Expressed in Just a couple of Verses

8
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:21,460
Ik Dooje Se Hue Judaa, Jab Ik Dooje Ke Liye Bane
We are separated from one-another, even if We are made for each-other

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,330
Teri Meri, Meri Teri Prem Kahani Hai Mushkil

Aa ..

12
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,930
Tumse Dil Jo Lagaya, Toh Jahaan Maine Paaya
On giving You my Heart, I got the World in return

13
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:19,260
Kabhi Socha Na Tha Yun, Meelon Door Hoga Saaya
But I never thought that even Your Shadow would be miles away

14
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,860
Kyun Khuda Tune Mujhe Aisa Khwaab Dikhaya
Why Oh God! You gave me such a Dream

15
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:31,600
Jab Haqeeqat Mein Usse Todna Tha
Because it was Sure to Break in Reality

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,130
Aa ..

17

Teri Meri, Meri Teri Prem Kahani Hai Mushkil

Do Lafzon Mein Yeh Bayaan Na Ho Paaye
It can't be Expressed in Just a couple of Verses

20
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,730
Teri Meri Baaton Ka Har Lamha Sab Se Anjaana
Every moment of Our Conversations is not known to any one else

21
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,000
Do Lafzon Mein Yeh Bayaan Na Ho Paaye
It can't be Expressed in Just a couple of Verses

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,533
Har Ehsaas Mein Tu Hai, Har Ik Yaad Mein Tera Afsaana
You're in each and every feeling, You're there in each one of my thoughts

Aa ..

25
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:48,000
Saara Din Bit Jaaye, Saari Raat Jagaaye
The whole day passes away, the night keeps me awake

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Bas Khayal Tumhara, Lamha Lamha Tadpaaye
Just the thought of Yours, troubles me every moment

27
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,333
Yeh Tadap Keh Rahi Hai Mit Jaaye Faasle
This unbearable longing for You wishes to end all distance

28
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeh Tere Mere Darmeyaan Hai Jo Saare
That remain between Us

29
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,400
Ik Dooje Se Hue Judaa, Jab Ik Dooje Ke Liye Bane
We are separated from one-another, even if We are made for each-other
